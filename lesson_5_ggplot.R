# Basic ggplot plots
#----------------------------------

# Let's make a simple histogram of the age of our sample
# First we feed a dataset into ggplot with piping
# Next we tell ggplot what variables should map to which parameters of the plot
# Then we tell ggplot the geometry of the figure we would like it to create
# Finally, we specify other options about our plot, such as labels or the scale

slim_df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = AGE)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) +
  labs(title = "Histogram of Age in NHIS survey sample")

# Now let's do something fancy and estimate age density functions by gender

slim_df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = AGE, fill = sex_clean)) +
  geom_density(alpha = .6) +
  labs(title = "Density of Age by Gender")

slim_df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = sex_clean, y = AGE)) +
  geom_violin() +
  labs(title = "Violin density of Age by Gender")

# I couldn't think of a useful scatter plot, but the geometry for that is geom_point()
  
# Now it's your turn to write some code that makes a beautiful plot that impresses me
# Be sure to use point geometry in one plot and histogram geometry in another


#--------------------------------
# Faceting with ggplot
#--------------------------------

# Oftentimes, we are attempting to render a complex relationship between a variety
# of different variables and it becomes important to avoid clutter.

# Below I will compare gender and education differences in the histograms of BMI in
# our sample using a technique called faceting:

slim_df %>%
  ggplot(aes(educ_clean, fill = as.character(HEALTH))) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  facet_grid(sex_clean ~ .) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  labs(title = "Proportion reporting each health level by education and gender",
       y = "Proportion",
       x = "Education Level",
       fill = "Health Level")

# Now you make some awesome faceted plots below!!
