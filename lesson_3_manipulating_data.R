# Setting up workspace

# This snippet of code is a little loop that makes my code work on your computer
root <- getwd()
while(basename(root) != "Oeconomica-Health-Cohort") {
  root <- dirname(root)
}

# This line runs the script in your data.R file so that each person can have
# their data in a different place because everyone's file structure will be 
# a little differnt
source(file.path(root, "data.R"))


# These are some fantastic packages that I always load in
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(lubridate)
library(knitr)
library(purrr)
library(tidyr)
library(stringr)

# This is the step where I actually import the data
df <- read.csv(file.path(ddir, "nhis_00001.csv.gz"))


#----------------------------------
# Selecting data
#----------------------------------

# our dataframe, df, has a ton of different variables, the following code just
# selects a few variables of interest to look at: Age, Sex, Education, and Health
# the code below uses something called piping %>% which puts the output of the
# last line into the input of the next:

slim_df <-
  df %>%
  select(AGE, SEX, EDUC, HEALTH)

#Now we want to know what is going on with some variable: simply use the
# following code:

# To list all the things a variable is coded as
unique(df$SEX)

# To summarize the information in a variable
summary(df$AGE)

 # Now let's say we only want people whose sex is coded as 1. I will do the same
# thing three differnt ways to illustrate why piping is useful

slim_df_sex_one <-
  df %>%
  select(AGE, SEX, EDUC, HEALTH) %>%
  filter(SEX == 1)
  
slim_df_sex_one <-
  slim_df %>%
  filter(SEX == 1)

slim_df_sex_one <-
  filter(select(df, AGE, SEX, EDUC, HEALTH), SEX == 1)

# As you can see, this last one is a bit of a pain to read and clearly see what 
# is going on. Now try some out for yourself:

# Select a different set of variables, explore the way they are coded using the 
# above summary statistics tools, and select some interesting subset


#--------------------------------
# Recoding data
#--------------------------------

# Sometimes we want nicer variable labels. This is my prefered method of recoding

# first create a sort of codebook table by looking up the codebook online

sex_codebook <-
  tibble(SEX = c(1,2),
         sex_clean = c("Male","Female"))

# Then merge in the new codings into the dataset:

df_clean <-
  df %>%
  left_join(sex_codebook, by = "SEX")

                                        # Now you try recoding education in a sensible way

educ_codebook <-
    tibble(EDUC = c(00,01,02,03,04,05,06,07,08,09,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,96,97,99),
